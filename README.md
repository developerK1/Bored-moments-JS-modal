# Bored-moments-JS-modal

The fun part is just seeing and doing. Sometimes it is just simple to brush the code with something as little as a modal.
Modal/Pop-up is interesting because it goes as further than a pop-up, but also positioning the modal on top of the content.
I am glad I did this exercise because it help me brush on my CSS skills that and the flexbox has made me forget a bit about it.
Thanks box-model and positioning has never been easy. Float where horrible!
